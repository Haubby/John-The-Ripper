## Applying John in our daily life
----------------------------------

> ### Installing John...

* First of all, we need to install 'john-the-ripper' using snap
```
sudo snap install john-the-ripper -y
```

_NOTE: john is included in snap version of john-the-ripper, & tested in Ubuntu 20.04_

* Alternatively, we can install it via _[:github:](https://github.com/openwall/john.git)_ and then follow the instructions explained in _[Openwall](https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/INSTALL.shtml)_

> ### How to Crack a Linux Password ?

* Now, let's crack a Linux password. In Linux, there are two important files saved in the /etc directory: passwd and shadow

/etc/passwd -> stores information like username, user id, login shell, etc.
/etc/shadow -> contains password hash, password expiry, etc.

* In addition to the 'john' command, John comes with a few other utilities. One of them is called 'unshadow'

* The unshadow command combines the passwd and shadow files together into a single file. This can then be used by John to crack passwords

* Here's how we can use the unshadow command
```
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > output.db
```

This command will combine the files together and create an output.db file. We can now crack the output.db file using John
```
john output.db
```

* John tries to find the password for all the users in the passwd file and generates the output with the list of cracked passwords
* Again, you can use custom wordlists via the --wordlist flag

> ### How to Crack a Windows Password ?

* In Windows, the password hashes are stored in the SAM database. SAM uses the LM/NTLM hash format for passwords, so we will be using John to crack one

* Getting passwords from the SAM database is out of scope for this article, but let's assume you have acquired a password hash for a Windows user

* Here's the command to crack it:
```
john --format=lm crack.txt
```

* The crack.txt will contain the password hash
* If John is unable to crack the password using its default wordlist, you can use the RockYou wordlist using theâ€Š--wordlist flag

> ### How to Crack a Zip File Password ?

* Let's try to crack a zip file password. To do that, we need to get the hash of the zip file's password

* Like unshadow, John has another utility called 'zip2john'. 
* zip2john helps us to get the hash from zip file. If you are cracking a .rar file, you can use the rar2john utility

* Here's the syntax to get the password hash of a zip file
```
john-the-ripper.zip2john test.zip > zip.hash
```

* The above command will get the hash from the zip file and store it in the 'zip.hash' file. You can then use John to crack the hash
```
john-the-ripper.zip2john zip.hash
```

* To decrypt the hash
```
john-the-ripper zip.hash
```

* John also has several other functionalities that will help you crack a variety of passwords.
